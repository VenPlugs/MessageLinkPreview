# MessageLinkPreview

Plugin that embeds message links. Unlike other similar plugins, this plugin embeds the actual message components,
which means embedded messages look just like the originals. Also allows nested embeds lmao

Full credit to [cynosphere](https://gitlab.com/Cynosphere) who originally made this plugin for cumcord
([repo](https://gitlab.com/Cynosphere/cumcord-plugins)). I just ported it to PowerCord
